# diffusionSimulation
An interactive simulation in Processing Javascript that simluates simple diffusion, the net movement of particles 
from an area of high concentration to that of low concentration. The program first generates a line down the middle 
of a blank screen; this line represents the cell membrane. Then, the user can add multiples of five red and blue particles 
onto the screen; the red particles take a random initial position on the left, and the blue particles on the right. 
When the user presses the spacebar, the balls move in a random direction for a certain number of seconds, and if 
the user continues to do this, the particles should achieve a state of equilibrium, meaning that the number of 
red and blue balls on the left is equal to that on the right. For each particle group(red and blue), the user 
is also able to adjust its speed and whether its particles are able to diffuse across the membrane.
